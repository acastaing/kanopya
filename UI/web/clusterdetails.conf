	'graph_dir_alias' is the apache2 Alias to the directory containing graphs
	
	To periodically auto-generate graphs, use <generate_graph> in monitor.conf
	
	the cgi script looks for graph named:
		- for nodes: graph_<HOST_IP>_<SET_NAME>.png for all SET_NAME in sets tag (separator is ',')
		- for cluster: graph_<CLUSTER_NAME>_<INDICATOR>.png for all INDICATOR in indicators tag (separator is ',') 
	This is the (current) naming convention for generated graph
