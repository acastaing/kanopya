=head1 NAME

EOperation - Abstract class of EOperation object.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $operation = Operation->getNexOp();
    my $eoperation = EOperation->new(data => $operation);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

EOperation is an abstract class of different operations available in kanopya executor.
Each eoperation could be composed by the following methods.
- prepare (pre-execution)
- execute
- finish (post-execution)
EOperations contain :
- _operation : Operation : Operation send by user (human or software).
This attribute is Operation created by user and saved in database. 
This operation is loaded from database by EFactory and stored into EOperation
- duration_report : Scalar (Int) : Default 20  : Report time duration. 
It is time waited by operation when it is reported.
