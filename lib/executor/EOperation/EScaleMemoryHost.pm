EOperation::EScaleMemoryHost - Operation class implementing memory scale in

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This Object represent an operation.
It allows to implement cluster activation operation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Component is an abstract class of operation objects

=head1 METHODS

use Entity::Host;
use EFactory;

our $VERSION = '1.00';
