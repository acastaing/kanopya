=head1 NAME

EEntity::EOperation::EStartCluster - Operation class implementing cluster starting operation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This Object represent an operation.
It allows to implement cluster starting operation

=head1 DESCRIPTION



=head1 METHODS

=cut
package EOperation::EStartCluster;

use strict;
use warnings;
use Log::Log4perl "get_logger";
use base "EOperation";

use Kanopya::Exceptions;
use Entity::Cluster;
use Entity::Motherboard;

my $log = get_logger("executor");
my $errmsg;

our $VERSION = "1.00";

=head2 new

    my $op = EOperation::EStartCluster->new();

EOperation::EStartCluster->new creates a new EStartCluster operation.

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my %args = @_;
    
    my $self = $class->SUPER::new(%args);
    $self->_init();
    
    return $self;
}

=head2 _init

	$op->_init() is a private method used to define internal parameters.

=cut

sub _init {
	my $self = shift;

	return;
}

=head2 prepare

	$op->prepare();

=cut

sub prepare {
	my $self = shift;
	my %args = @_;
	$self->SUPER::prepare();

	if (! exists $args{internal_cluster} or ! defined $args{internal_cluster}) { 
		$errmsg = "EStartCluster->prepare need an internal_cluster named argument!";
		$log->error($errmsg);
		throw Kanopya::Exception::Internal::IncorrectParam(error => $errmsg);
	}
	
	my $adm = Administrator->new();
	my $params = $self->_getOperation()->getParams();

	$self->{_objs} = {};
	
	# Get cluster to start from param
	$self->{_objs}->{cluster} = Entity::Cluster->get(id => $params->{cluster_id});
}

sub execute {
	my $self = shift;
	$self->SUPER::execute();
	my $adm = Administrator->new();
		
	$log->info('getting minimum number of nodes to start');
	my $nodes_to_start = $self->{_objs}->{cluster}->getAttr(name => 'cluster_min_node');	
	$log->info('getting free motherboards');
#	my @free_motherboards = Entity::Motherboard->getMotherboards(hash => { active => 1, motherboard_state => 'down'});
#	
#	my $priority = $self->_getOperation()->getAttr(attr_name => 'priority');
#	
#
#	for(my $i=0 ; $i < $nodes_to_start ; $i++) {
#		my $motherboard = pop @free_motherboards;
#		$self->{_objs}->{cluster}->addNode(motherboard_id => $motherboard->getAttr(name => 'motherboard_id'));
#	} 	

	# Just call Master node addition, other node will be add by the state manager
    $self->{_objs}->{cluster}->addNode();
	$self->{_objs}->{cluster}->setAttr(name => 'cluster_state', value => 'starting:'.time);
	$self->{_objs}->{cluster}->save();
}
