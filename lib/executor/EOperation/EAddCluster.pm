EEntity::Operation::EAddHost - Operation class implementing Host creation operation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This Object represent an operation.
It allows to implement Host creation operation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Component is an abstract class of operation objects

=head1 METHODS

=cut
package EOperation::EAddCluster;
use base "EOperation";

use strict;
use warnings;

use Log::Log4perl "get_logger";
use Data::Dumper;
use Kanopya::Exceptions;
use EFactory;

use Entity::Cluster;
use Entity::Systemimage;
use Entity::Gp;

my $log = get_logger("executor");
my $errmsg;
our $VERSION = '1.00';

=head2 new

    my $op = EEntity::EOperation::EAddHost->new();

EEntity::Operation::EAddHost->new creates a new AddMotheboard operation.

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my %args = @_;
    
    $log->debug("Class is : $class");
    my $self = $class->SUPER::new(%args);
    $self->_init();
    
    return $self;
}

=head2 _init

    $op->_init() is a private method used to define internal parameters.

=cut

sub _init {
    my $self = shift;

    return;
}

=head2 prepare

    $op->prepare();

=cut

sub prepare {
    my $self = shift;
    my %args = @_;
    $self->SUPER::prepare();

    General::checkParams(args => \%args, required => ["internal_cluster"]);
    
    my $adm = Administrator->new();
    my $params = $self->_getOperation()->getParams();

    $self->{_objs} = {};
    
    # Cluster instantiation
    eval {
        $self->{_objs}->{cluster} = Entity::Cluster->new(%$params);
    };
    if($@) {
        my $err = $@;
        $errmsg = "EOperation::EAddCluster->prepare : Cluster instanciation failed because : " . $err;
        $log->error($errmsg);
        throw Kanopya::Exception::Internal::WrongValue(error => $errmsg);
    }

    $self->{econtext} = EFactory::newEContext(ip_source => "127.0.0.1", ip_destination => "127.0.0.1");

}



sub execute {
    my $self = shift;

    my $ecluster = EFactory::newEEntity(data => $self->{_objs}->{cluster});
    $ecluster->create(econtext => $self->{econtext},erollback => $self->{erollback});
    
    $log->info("Cluster <".$self->{_objs}->{cluster}->getAttr(name=>"cluster_name") ."> is now added");
}
