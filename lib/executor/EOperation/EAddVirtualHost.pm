=head1 NAME

EEntity::Operation::EAddVirtualHost - Operation class implementing Virutal machine creation operation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This Object represent an operation.
It allows to implement Virutal machine creation operation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Component is an abstract class of operation objects

=head1 METHODS

=cut
package EOperation::EAddVirtualHost;
use base "EOperation";

use strict;
use warnings;

use Kanopya::Exceptions;
use EFactory;
use Template;
use Log::Log4perl "get_logger";
use Data::Dumper;

use Entity::Host;
use Entity::ServiceProvider::Inside::Cluster;
use Entity::Gp;
use Operation;
use ERollback;

my $log = get_logger("executor");
my $errmsg;
our $VERSION = '1.00';

=head2 new

    my $op = EEntity::EOperation::EAddVirtualHost->new();

EEntity::Operation::EAddVirtualHost->new creates a new AddMotheboard operation.

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my %args = @_;
    
    my $self = $class->SUPER::new(%args);
    $self->_init();
    
    return $self;
}

=head2 _init

    $op->_init() is a private method used to define internal parameters.

=cut

sub _init {
    my $self = shift;

    return;
}

=head2 prepare

    $op->prepare();

=cut

sub prepare {
    my $self = shift;
    my %args = @_;
    $self->SUPER::prepare();

    General::checkParams(args => \%args, required => ["internal_cluster"]);
    
    $log->debug("After Eoperation prepare and before get Administrator singleton");
    my $params = $self->_getOperation()->getParams();

    $self->{_objs} = {};
	
    # Instanciate the pre created Host Entity
    eval {

    };
    if($@) {
        my $err = $@;
        $errmsg = "EOperation::EAddVirtualHost->prepare : No host found with id $params->{host_id}\n" . $err;
        $log->error($errmsg);
        throw Kanopya::Exception::Internal::WrongValue(error => $errmsg);
    }
    
    # Instanciate target cluster
    eval {

        $errmsg = "EOperation::EAddVirtualHost->prepare : No cluster found with id $params->{target_cluster_id}\n" . $err;
        $log->error($errmsg);
        throw Kanopya::Exception::Internal::WrongValue(error => $errmsg);
    }
}

sub execute {
    my $self = shift;

	my @group = Entity::Gp->getGroups(hash => {gp_name=>'Host'});
	$group[0]->appendEntity(entity => $self->{_objs}->{host});
	$log->info("Virtual Host <".$self->{_objs}->{host}->getAttr(name=>"host_mac_address") ."> is now created");

	Operation->enqueue( 
		type     => 'PreStartNode',
		priority => 100,
		params   => {  
			host_id    => $self->{_objs}->{host}->getAttr(name => 'host_id'),
			cluster_id => $self->{_objs}->{cluster}->getAttr(name => 'cluster_id'),
		}
	);

}
