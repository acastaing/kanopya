@contructor

EOperation factory, instantiate the proper concrete EOperation from
the operation type, unserialize the parameters from tha json stored in database
and keep them as private field.
The parameters are splited in two categories:
 - params: regular parameters as scalar, list, or hash parameters
 - context: execution entities instanciated from the ids stored in dabatase, context objects
            are r/w locked during the following operation steps: prepare, finish and cancel.
            This is during thoses steps that the states of the execution entities can be
            updated atomically.

@param operation the operation

Ensure all prerequisites for the operation execution,
like resources availability.
If a resource not available or a device not responding yet,
the operation can be reported about a specified amount of seconds.
Ths step can also be used to prepend an ambedded workflow and
report the operation, and so execute a required workflow before
retrying the current operation.
