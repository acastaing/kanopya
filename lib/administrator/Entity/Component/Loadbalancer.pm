<Entity::Component::Loadbalancer> – <General class for component abstraction>

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to <Entity::Component::Loadbalancer> version 1.0.0.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use <Entity::Component::Loadbalancer>;

my $component_instance_id = 2; # component instance id

Entity::Component::Loadbalancer->get(id=>$component_instance_id);

# Cluster id

my $cluster_id = 3;

# Component id are fixed, please refer to component id table

my $component_id =2 

Entity::Component::Loadbalancer->new(component_id=>$component_id, cluster_id=>$cluster_id);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Entity::Component::Loadbalancer is an abstract class of component objects

=head1 METHODS

=cut

package Entity::Component::Loadbalancer;
use base "Entity::Component";

use strict;
use warnings;

use Kanopya::Exceptions;
use Data::Dumper;
use Log::Log4perl "get_logger";

our $VERSION = '1.00';

my $log = get_logger("administrator");
my $errmsg;



=head2 new
B<Class>   : Public
B<Desc>    : This method allows to create a new instance of Loadbalancer component.
          This is an abstract class, DO NOT instantiate it.
B<args>    : 
    B<component_id> : I<Int> : Identify component. Refer to component identifier table
    B<cluster_id> : I<int> : Identify cluster owning the component instance
B<Return>  : a new Entity::Component::Loadbalancer from parameters.
B<Comment>  : 
To save data in DB call save() on returned obj (after modification)
Like all component, instantiate it creates a new empty component instance.
You have to populate it with dedicated methods.
B<throws>  : 
    B<Kanopya::Exception::Internal::IncorrectParam> When missing mandatory parameters

		$log->error($errmsg);
		throw Kanopya::Exception::Internal::IncorrectParam(error => $errmsg);
	}
	# We create a new DBIx containing new entity
	my $self = $class->SUPER::new( %args);

    return $self;
}

=head2 get
B<Class>   : Public
B<Desc>    : This method allows to get an existing of Loadbalancer component.
          This is an abstract class, DO NOT instantiate it.
B<args>    : 
    B<component_instance_id> : I<Int> : identify component instance 
B<Return>  : a new Entity::Component::Loadbalancer from Kanopya Database
B<Comment>  : To modify data in DB call save() on returned obj (after modification)
B<throws>  : 
    B<Kanopya::Exception::Internal::IncorrectParam> When missing mandatory parameters
	
=cut

    my $class = shift;
    my %args = @_;

		$errmsg = "Entity::Component::Loadbalancer->new need an id named argument!";

		throw Kanopya::Exception::Internal::IncorrectParam(error => $errmsg);
	}
   my $self = $class->SUPER::get( %args);
   return $self;
}

Exceptions are thrown when mandatory arguments are missing.
Exception : Kanopya::Exception::Internal::IncorrectParam
