Utility class providing several measures for evaluating the accuracy of a theorical dataset, compared to 
known real experimental values.

Measure the accuracy of a theorical dataset compared to real/experimental values (so they must be known), 
using different kinds of measures.

@param theorical_data_ref A reference to the theorical dataset (must be stored in an array). 
@param real_data_ref A reference to the real dataset (must be stored in an array).

@return A ref to a hash containing several accuracy measures ('me', 'mae', 'mse', 'rmse').

Ensure that a theorical dataset and a experimental one have the same length (otherwise the accuracy of the 
theorical one cannot be measured). If they do, returns this length, else throws an exception.

@param theorical_data_ref A reference to the theorical dataset (must be stored in an array). 
@param real_data_ref A reference to the real dataset (must be stored in an array).

@return The datasets length, if it is the same.
