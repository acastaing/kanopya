perform a prediction.

=begin classdoc

Method called from child class instance to compute the forcasting.
By default the method return a hash with two keys 'timestamps' (reference to an array of timestamps)
and 'values' (reference an array of forecasted values).

@param function_args all the arguments of the forcasting function

@return the forecasted values as an array ref.
