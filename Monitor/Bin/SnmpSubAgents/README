Install new module in the snmp master agent.

	1. Copy the sub-agent perl file (xxx_snmp_module.pl) in a directory of your choice (ex: /etc/snmp/)
	
	2. In /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf, at the end of file, add the line:  
			perl do '/abolute/path/xxx_snmp_module.pl';

	3. Restart the snmp deamon.


WARNING:
	The deamon is executed as user 'snmp'.
	Some sub-agents need to execute commands as root, to allow this we have to add these commands in the sudoers.
	see sudoers.conf in each sub-agent directory.

Enabling MIB.
	The MIB file is not required, but is useful to know data structure and valid oids.
	When MIB is enabled, snmp request can be done using the var name instead of its oid.
	
	1. Copy the MIB file XXX-MIB.txt into the snmp mib directory (/usr/share/snmp/mibs)
	2. In /etc/snmp/snmp.conf (create it if doesn't exist) add the line  'mibs +ISCSI-MIB'.
