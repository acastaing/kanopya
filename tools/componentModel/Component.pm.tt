<Entity::Component::[% component_name %]> <[% component_name %] component concret class>

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to <Entity::Component::[% component_name %]> version 1.0.0.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use <Entity::Component::[% component_name %]>;

my $component_instance_id = 2; # component instance id

Entity::Component::[% component_name %]->get(id=>$component_instance_id);

# Cluster id

my $cluster_id = 3;

# Component id are fixed, please refer to component id table

my $component_id =2 

Entity::Component::[% component_name %]->new(component_id=>$component_id, cluster_id=>$cluster_id);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Entity::Component::[% component_name %] is class allowing to instantiate a [% component_name %] component
This Entity is empty but present methods to set configuration.

=head2 new
B<Class>   : Public
B<Desc>    : This method allows to create a new instance of [% component_category %] component and concretly [% component_name %].
B<args>    : 
    B<component_id> : I<Int> : Identify component. Refer to component identifier table
    B<cluster_id> : I<int> : Identify cluster owning the component instance
B<Return>  : a new Entity::Component::[% component_name %] from parameters.
B<Comment>  : Like all component, instantiate it creates a new empty component instance.
        You have to populate it with dedicated methods.
