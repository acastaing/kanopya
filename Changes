Revision history for Kanopya development

0.01    Nov 2008 to April 2009 - Technical Test
		This release was not a real version, it was a technical test which
		consist on testing technology to apply microCluster concept
		
0.1		May 2009 to Sept 2009 Internal PoC version Kanopya
        First version, it allows us to test and benchmark first functionalities,
        technology used and development of Kanopya
        	- Model with only object without management instance
        		+ motherboard, cluster, node, systemimage, applications, kernels
        	- Integrate statically atftp, apache2,dhcpd, nfs
        	- All Data were already stored in db

0.2		Sep 2009 to April 2010 Benchmark release
		- This version was released to benchmark kanopya on extremely solicited environment
		We use SpecWeb to benchmark
		- This version introduce notion of manager to use object, this solution allows to 
		manipulate object abstraction.
		- This version has a console interface.

0.3		July 2010 - Oct 2010 Beta version
		This version brings new features
			- Separation of differents Kanopya's parts to independant program
				+ Administrator : This application manages the configurations
				+ Executor : This application executes request on the microCluster
				+ Boot Server : This server (it is not an application) hosts the PXE
				+ Monitor : This program get informations from node, store into db,
							Monitor node trap (boot and halt)
				+ Orchestrator : This program use data collected by monitor to optimize
								 MicroCluster energy consumption and guarantee to
								 application QoS
			- Solve parallel request management with execution list and an unic executor
			- This version include some template to manage application
			- Component modelisation : Allows a flexible application management and 
									   integration of a lot of midlleware applications
			- Operation modelisation : Allows standardize interaction with the system and
									   solve parallel execution problems
			- Web interface
			- Users messages
			- Users right
