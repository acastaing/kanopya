EEntity::Operation::EAddMotherboard - Operation class implementing Motherboard creation operation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This Object represent an operation.
It allows to implement Motherboard creation operation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Component is an abstract class of operation objects

=head1 METHODS

=cut
package EOperation::ERemoveMotherboardFromCluster;

use strict;
use warnings;
use Log::Log4perl "get_logger";
use Data::Dumper;
use vars qw(@ISA $VERSION);
use base "EOperation";
use lib qw (/workspace/mcs/Executor/Lib /workspace/mcs/Common/Lib);
use McsExceptions;
use EFactory;

my $log = get_logger("executor");
my $errmsg;
$VERSION = do { my @r = (q$Revision: 0.1 $ =~ /\d+/g); sprintf "%d."."%02d" x $#r, @r };

=head2 new

    my $op = EEntity::EOperation::EAddMotherboard->new();

EEntity::Operation::EAddMotherboard->new creates a new AddMotheboard operation.

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my %args = @_;
    
    $log->debug("Class is : $class");
    my $self = $class->SUPER::new(%args);
    $self->_init();
    
    return $self;
}

=head2 _init

	$op->_init() is a private method used to define internal parameters.

=cut

sub _init {
	my $self = shift;

	return;
}

=head2 prepare

	$op->prepare();

=cut

sub prepare {
	my $self = shift;
	my %args = @_;
	$self->SUPER::prepare();

	if (! exists $args{internal_cluster} or ! defined $args{internal_cluster}) { 
		$errmsg = "ERemoveMotherboardInCluster->prepare need an internal_cluster named argument!"; 
		$log->error($errmsg);
		throw Mcs::Exception::Internal::IncorrectParam(error => $errmsg);
	}

	my $adm = Administrator->new();
	my $params = $self->_getOperation()->getParams();

	$self->{_objs} = {};
	$self->{econtext} = EFactory::newEContext(ip_source => "127.0.0.1", ip_destination => "127.0.0.1");

	# Get instance of Cluster Entity
	$self->{_objs}->{cluster} = $adm->getEntity(type => "Cluster", id => $params->{cluster_id});
	
	# Get instance of Cluster Entity
	$self->{_objs}->{motherboard} = $adm->getEntity(type => "Motherboard", id => $params->{motherboard_id});
}

	$log->debug("Before EOperation exec");
	$self->SUPER::execute();
	$log->debug("After EOperation exec and before new Adm");
	my $adm = Administrator->new();
	$log->debug("After Adm");
	
	#TODO Update export (etc, root, mount_point)
	$adm->removeNode(motherboard_id => $self->{_objs}->{motherboard}->getAttr(name=>"motherboard_id"),
					 cluster_id => $self->{_objs}->{cluster}->getAttr(name=>"cluster_id"));
